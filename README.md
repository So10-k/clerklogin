- Clone the new repository
   ```sh
   git clone <repo url>
   ```
### Create Clerk Account + New Application
- If you don't already have an account with Clerk you can easily set one up with just a few steps [here](https://clerk.dev). Once your account is created you should be prompted to create a new application, you will need to add a name for your new app and can keep the pre-selected settings under 'Standard Authentication' and 'Connected Accounts'. You will then be sent to the Application dashboard, which you will need to go back to when deploying your new site.

## Development

- Install all dependencies & the [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/):

  ```sh
  npm install
  npm install netlify-cli -g
  ```

- Create or connect to your Netlify project by running through the Netlify `init` script. This will walk you through the process of setting up and deploying your site on Netlify:

  ```sh
  netlify init
  ```

- For the Environment variables the API and JWT keys will be located under Developers > API Keys within the Clerk dashboard. Add your [Clerk environment variables](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/) to a `.env` file like [`.env.local.sample`](./.env.local.sample) file or through the Netlify project dashboard at [https://app.netlify.com/](https://app.netlify.com/) Site settings/Build & deploy/Environment:

  ```
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API="" 
  CLERK_API_KEY=""
  CLERK_JWT_KEY=""
  ```
  > ðŸš¨ Once you've added in the environment variables, you will need to go to the 'Deploy' tab within your Netlify Dashboard and trigger a new deploy. 

- Start dev server (This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.):

  ```sh
  npm run dev
  or
  netlify dev
  ```
Your new site should now be up and running!
